## About
- A local Steam Marketplace scraper which acts as an independent Python program (no Jupyter Notebook dependency).
- Coding originally done as the final project/writeup for an _Introduction to Python_ course.
- Due to my lack of Python skills, steps of the project are divided across multiple files, requiring a lot of manual oversight. This is not ideal.

#### Steps
- [ ] Upload original code
- [ ] Consolidate steps into a single repo
  - [ ] Pull all GAME appids
    - [ ] Ensure no duplicates
  - [ ] Pull data on each GAME appid
  - [ ] Incorporate STEAMSPY data??? (Original project did this. Ensure the gathered data is worthwhile.)
- [ ] Ensure functionality of each function
- [ ] Develop program UI
- [ ] Ensure functionality of compiled program
#### Features/Improvements
- [ ] Program has persistent memory of appids, reducing API query time (72hrs is __way__ too long)
- [ ] Progam automatically conducts data analysis
- [ ] Improve UI/UX
  - [ ] Graphs & charts
  - [ ]"Sexy" (non-placeholder) buttons
