## About
- A local Steam Marketplace scraper which acts as an independent Python program (no Jupyter Notebook dependency).
- Coding originally done as the final project/writeup for an _Introduction to Python_ course.
- Due to my lack of Python skills, steps of the project are divided across multiple files, requiring a lot of manual oversight. This is not ideal.

#### Steps
- [x] Upload original code
- [x] Refactor hulking code spaghetti into helper progams to main.py
  - [ ] API interfaces (Steam & SteamSpy)
  - [ ] Database (MongoDB & SQLite)
  - [ ] Cleaning (general & language)
  - [ ] Analysis (Matplotlib)
  - [ ] Streamlit (Analysis usign Streamlit w/ interface)
- [ ] Ensure functionality of each helper program
- [ ] Develop program UI (Not necessary using Streamlit???)
- [ ] Ensure functionality of compiled program
#### Features/Improvements
- [ ] Program has persistent memory of appids, reducing API query time (72hrs is __way__ too long)
- [ ] Progam automatically conducts data analysis
- [ ] Improve UI/UX
  - [ ] Graphs & charts
  - [ ] "Sexy" (non-placeholder) buttons
