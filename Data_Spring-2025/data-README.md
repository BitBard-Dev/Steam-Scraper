## README for data file explaining purpose of the folder

## ISSUE: Files are too big to simply upload as and zipping folders is still too large for the entire dataset. Uploading individual zips is feasible, but time consuming for old data.

## RECOMMEND: Improving code, deciding which files are relevant to the analysis, __then__ upload zipped old dataset as a backup.
## ALTERNATIVE: Don't upload the old data, instead run a comparison of the two, showing changes throughout the time period.
### Possibly use Silk Song as a case study???
